## 29-Oct-2018

Call participants: Liz Brooks, Dan Hennen, Alejandro Yanez, Dvora Hart

For simulated data:
  # clarify timing of M change versus timing of selectivity change (should not be in same year)
  # need short description of the parameterization and assumptions for Gadget data simulation (we couldn't find this in the manual on the Gadget wiki)
  # can observation error be generated by Gadget?
  
  
Tasks:
  # Alejandro: come up with cool name for his age-based model
  # Everyone: literatuer search
  # Dvora: to check that simulated length/age output is in a format she can use
  
  
Next call:
  # Early December would be a good target
  # Wait to receive simulated data before scheduling next call so we can follow-up with questions about output
  # Will send a final email to WGMG folks who did not respond to previous email about their continued participation in this subgroup
