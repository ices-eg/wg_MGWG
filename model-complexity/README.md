##Outline

1. need to consider the complexity of the stock being modeled

...  simulation work with perhaps 2 different patterns of complexity {to be decided}:

i)   groundfish and invertebrate
ii)  differences in mortality, plastic growth, rate of maturation
iii) incorporate process error in M, length, SR
iv)  simulation cases:

2. compare and learn from models that have similar data input and the question is how complex those models need to be

... [review literature for other studies of determining model complexity]
... list of models to apply and who can run those {to be determined}
* any current state space models that can fit to length data?
* gadget may be able to do length and also simulate
* casal can do length but isn't state space
* look at droppinig age info and see what you can get with just length data
* VPA   -Liz, Helen?
* SCAA (ASAP?) -Liz, Helen?
* SS (SAM?) - Geir
* CASA/SAMS -Dvora
* CASAL - (Craig in group 1)
* Gadget - (Arni)
* SS?

3. look at diagnostics (residuals, support for model assumptions); is information criteria 

reliable for model selection ? retrospective pattern; predictive performance ; uncertainty measured by the models versus the true uncertainty

4. can simple models provide additional diagnostics to inform the complex model (example: BH mean length for length based model; catch curve for age based model)

5. where the drop-offs are: what do you lose by using a simpler model; is the advice given less informative or limited?  .

6. Management advice :stock status, catch advice ; depends on what managers want to get out of the assmt model : catch advice or effort adjustment--days fishing or number of boats; can 
you give advice at all?  if the data quality is not high, what advice can (should) be given?

###Other thoughts:
- how to explain the complex models to the public (words and pictures)
- if you have length and age, use one or both? pros/cons?
