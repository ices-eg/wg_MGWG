Analyses to be done on output (and proposed analyst--subject to change) as of November 13, 2020:
1. External SR fitting (with and without using variance-covariance; Maybe Noel's nonparametric method; also test what EQSim package identifies for Bmsy, Fmsy, MSY) (Colin)
2. Comparisons of estimated values with true values - recruitment parameters (e.g., "alpha" "beta"), recruitment, SSB, and F time series and recruitment variance when possible (Iago)
3. For external fits, evaluation of whether AIC selects the correct OM (colin)
4. For internal fits, evaluation of whether AIC selects the correct OM.  Thinking table of scenario, iter, Ricker AIC, BH AIC, "winner", is the "winner" correct.  Summary stats likely necessary to ID how frequently AIC worked. (Jon, Liz, Tim).

other ideas?
-summarize # converged fits per simulated case (# iterations per run)?
