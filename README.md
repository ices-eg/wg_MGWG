# ICES Methods Working Group

## Letter of invitation, Lowestoft 14-18 November 2022

(to MGWG members, sent 23 March 2022)
Dear stock assessment experts,  

The ICES Methods Working Group will be meeting 14-18 November 2022 in Lowestoft, England, at the historic CEFAS laboratory and you are invited to attend!  

As the Chairs of the WG, our goal is to bring together the best stock assessment modellers from all continents, to share experiences, and have fun together. In consultation with ICES HQ, the Terms of Reference have been modified from the previous cycle to be more focused on the application of stock assessment models to address specific questions. The full Terms of Reference are attached, but briefly are:  

*	Share new techniques for use in stock assessment
*	Evaluate details of stock assessment models
*	Validate new methods
*	Identify need for ICES training courses
*	Prioritize and address modeling questions supplied by ICES EGs  

We will also have an opportunity to discuss the projects begun during the last cycle of the ICES MGWG. These projects can be found on the GitHub site of the ICES Methods Working Group (https://github.com/ices-eg/MGWG).  

To register, please complete the following doodle poll
https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/xe7GJnye
to let us know you are attending the 2022 meeting. We will be following up with an email about logistics in Lowestoft. The plan is for an in person meeting. We may be able to make part of the meeting virtual, but probably cannot make the entire meeting virtual unless the in person meeting is not possible.  

Feel free to forward the invitation to those you think might be interested.
All the best,
Chris and Anders

## Letter of invitation, Seattle 23-27 September 2019

(to MGWG members, sent 8 Aug 2019)

Dear MGWG members,

I am very much looking forward to our meeting next month in Seattle, 23-27
September. We will be meeting in the Fishery Sciences Building
(http://uw.edu/maps/?fsh) from 9:00-17:00 Monday-Thursday, and 9:00-16:00
Friday. For the MGWG meeting, our main contacts in Seattle are Cole Monnahan,
Trevor Branch, and Kelli Johnson.

The draft agenda for Monday is: welcome and status update of ongoing MGWG
projects, discussion with Seattle scientists (UW, NOAA, IPHC) about ongoing MGWG
projects, an invitation to join the MGWG, and a group evaluation and decision
whether to launch a new MGWG project during the meeting. Tuesday to Friday: work
on projects.

To interact with the local scientists, we may organize lunchtime seminars and
guided walks through the local parks and pubs. Potential lunchtime seminar
topics include the (1) MGWG state-space project, (2) MGWG selectivity project,
and (3) ICES Transparent Assessment Framework. The state-space project is
submitting an abstract for the CAPAM workshop in New Zealand in November and the
selectivity project has an accepted abstract for the ICES conference in Sweden
in September.

Please use the Doodle poll

## Annual Science Conference 2019

Let's present our projects at ICES ASC 2019 in Sweden! The deadline for
submitting abstracts is 11 March 2019.

https://www.ices.dk/news-and-events/asc/asc2019/Pages/Call-for-abstracts.aspx

As a quick overview, here is a list of themes with abbreviated titles:

- (A) **Habitat** models to inform ecosystem-based management
- (B) Marine **aquaculture**
- (C) **Machine** learning
- (D) **Ecosystem** vulnerability
- (E) Assessment models with stock **components** and/or migration
- (F) **Management** objectives, trade-offs, MSE
- (G) **Ecosystem** structure and life history
- (H) Non-quota and **data-poor** stocks
- (I) Humans within ecosystems, **socio-economic** aspects
- (J) **Algal** blooms and jellyfish
- (K) Energy transfer through the **food webs**
- (L) Biological **adaptation** to climate change and fisheries
- (M) Quantifying **seabed** impact
- (N) **Data-limited** stock assessment methods
- (O) Vulnerable marine ecosystems in the **deep sea**
- (P) **Mixed** fishery management, discards and choke effects
- (Q) Small-scale and **recreational** fisheries

Mapping our projects to these theme sessions could look something like this:

1. state-space:
   [N](https://www.ices.dk/news-and-events/asc/asc2019/Pages/Theme-sessions.aspx)
2. stock-recruitment:
   [N](https://www.ices.dk/news-and-events/asc/asc2019/Pages/Theme-sessions.aspx)
3. model-complexity:
   [N](https://www.ices.dk/news-and-events/asc/asc2019/Pages/Theme-sessions.aspx)
4. selectivity:
   [P](https://www.ices.dk/news-and-events/asc/asc2019/Pages/Theme-sessions.aspx)

A presentation at a conference can be a great stepping stone, to transition from
the initial analysis and results stage towards writing up a cohesive story in a
manuscript.

Although the 11 March deadline for abstracts is close, keep in mind that the
abstract can be short and somewhat vague, and we have until 9 September to
prepare the slides. Later that month, we have our MGWG meeting in 23-27
September, so our project presentations/slides are due in September anyway :)

Even if only one person from a project subgroup can make it to the ASC, that
person could present the research findings and celebrate that milestone in
Sweden, Abba style!

## New co-chair

MGWG proposes *Chris Legault* as a new co-chair from 2019 onwards, as
recommended by all participants at the 2018 meeting in Ispra. Congratulations to
Chris and all of us!

***

## Vacancy for a co-chair

We are seeking applications for the role of co-chair of the ICES Methods WG.

The responsibilities of the co-chair will be to coordinate, guide, and support
the working group to reach its objectives. See
http://www.ices.dk/community/groups/Pages/MGWG.aspx.

You will join a dynamic and collaborative international team of scientists, who
are committed to providing a welcoming, efficient and rewarding working
environment, and advancing the development of stock assessment methods.

**Main responsibilities**

The co-chair will initiate and maintain communication between WG members,
prepare and steer annual meetings, mentor new participants, compile and edit the
WG report, and assist with project management. In short, support WG members in
every way possible in their endeavor to co-author and publish valuable
contributions in the field of stock assessment methods.

**Qualifications and experience**

We seek a co-chair who is motivated, organised, collaborative and flexible.
Applicants are expected to have:

- A strong background in stock assessment methods.

- The ability to inspire, delegate tasks, and instill a positive teamwork
  spirit.

- Exceptional writing and presentation skills, computer literacy and attention
  to detail.

- Experience participating in international working groups that have
  successfully published group-authored papers in scientific journals.

- The ability to travel internationally 1-2 times per year, to attend the ICES
  Methods WG meeting and the ICES WGCHAIRS meeting.

**Terms of appointment**

The co-chair will be appointed following an election by the working group
members. It is a 3-year term, which can be followed by one other 3-year term.

Experience as a chair of an international working group of scientists is
considered a part of the professional portfolio as a senior scientist and in
academia. It is an opportunity to network with scientists worldwide and will
increase your visibility among peers. Also, for the right person, the
co-chairing task is enjoyable in itself.

The Methods WG will discuss the selection of a co-chair on Friday 14 September
2019, and a decision will be made soon afterwards.

***

## Next meeting

Tentative date for the next ICES Methods WG meeting:

**23-27 September 2019**

This timing gets us safely past family vacation time, makes it easier for NOAA
staff to get their travel funded, and enables people to attend related events
such as the JRC Ensemble Modelling group (26-30 Aug), ICES Annual Science
Conference (9-12 Sep), AFS Annual Meeting (29 Sep-3 Oct), etc.

Venue TBD.

## Letter of invitation, Ispra 10-14 Sep 2018

(sent 30 Apr 2018)

Dear stock assessment experts,

The ICES Methods Working Group will be meeting 10-14 September 2018 in Ispra,
Italy, and you are invited to attend!

As the Chair of the WG, my goal is to bring together the best stock assessment
modellers from all continents, to do good science and have fun together. The
overall objectives of the working group are:

* Develop and improve stock assessment models and techniques
* Leverage the international scope of the WG to analyze many models and datasets
* Publish multi-author papers related to stock assessment

Specific projects launched during the 2017 meeting in Woods Hole are:

1. State-space vs. traditional models
2. Internal vs. external stock recruitment
3. Appropriate level of model complexity
4. Selectivity as part of management advice

The ongoing research is organized on the GitHub site of the ICES Methods Working
Group (https://github.com/ices-eg/MGWG). If we get many participants this year,
we could perhaps add one more project during the meeting in Ispra, depending on
the background and interests of new participants. We are especially interested
in topics that bring together and compare a wide range of approaches, methods,
and datasets.

To register, please email Maria Lifentseva (maria.lifentseva@ices.dk) and me to
let us know you are attending the 2018 meeting. I will be following up with an
email about logistics in Ispra.

Feel free to forward the invitation to those you think might be interested.

All the best,<br>
Arni

## Planning the 2018 Meeting

**[Doodle poll](https://doodle.com/poll/q9xk8z9yn4pbmpgn)**

Having met in Woods Hole (USA) in 2017, we may have the 2018 meeting in Southern
Europe, to keep a balance between east and west, north and south :)

If we aim for the autumn, the NOAA fiscal year means September is good, and the
ICES ASC (24-27 Sep) means late September may not be a good time for the Methods
WG meeting.

Can we meet in the first or second week of September, 3-7 Sep or 10-14 Sep?
Please indicate and comment in the Doodle poll above.

## The plan

(18 Oct 2017)

Just a quick update on the upcoming ICES Methods working group, meeting in Woods
Hole 13-17 November.

At the meeting, we will identify paper-size topics that are well suited to
analyze and write as teams. When we decide during the meeting which topics will
be pursued by the Methods working group, we will consider things like:

1. Is this topic important for many stock assessment scientists?

2. Is there another working group already working on this topic?

3. How can this be structured into the format of a medium-size journal paper?

4. What kind of work is required, and how much work?

5. Do we have a suitable number of participants that would like to analyze and
   write this together?

6. Who would like to lead this group and what will the role of coauthors be?

So I'm hoping that we will discuss many potential topics during the meeting (and
a bit before and after the meeting). Once we have selected the topics, we will
move them to https://github.com/ices-eg/mgwg and follow the progress to
manuscript submission.

Since many of you cannot make it to the meeting this year, we will make an
effort to involve people in the discussion remotely. I will send another update
in the next couple of weeks when we have an online wiki, to coordinate the
discussion and decide on video conferencing times and format during the meeting.
Until then, feel free to send me ideas that I can put on the initial wiki to get
the discussion started.

Those of you who are coming to Woods Hole 13-17 November, please confirm with
Chris Legault <chris.legault@noaa.gov> and me, so we can choose a suitable
meeting room, get hotel recommendations, etc.

## Letter of Invitation

(19 Sep 2017)

Dear stock assessment experts,

The brand new ICES Methods Working Group will be meeting **13-17 November 2017
in Woods Hole**, and you are invited to attend!

As the Chair of the new WG, my goal is to bring together the best stock
assessment modellers from Europe, North America and elsewhere, to do good
science and have fun together. As a group, we will decide for ourselves which
research topics to pursue. The only message from the ICES leadership to the
group is: aim high and publish your findings.

The objectives of the working group are:

1. Develop and improve stock assessment models and techniques

2. Leverage the international scope of the WG to analyze many models and
   datasets

3. Publish multi-author papers related to stock assessment

The focus will mainly be on single-species models, diagnostics, forecasts,
uncertainty, statistical techniques, innovations, etc.

Specific objectives of this first meeting of the new Methods WG are:

* Identify main research topics

* Form teams

* Formulate papers to publish

We will be especially interested in topics that bring together and compare a
wide range of approaches, methods, and datasets.

---

I realize that 13-17 November is very close, and I apologize for the short
notice. If you are interested but unable to attend this first meeting, do not
despair: the Methods WG will meet annually and the 2018 meeting will be
announced with proper notice. Furthermore, feel free to participate remotely by
proposing research topics and shape the ideas that will continue to develop.

We can start some brainstorming in the weeks before the meeting, but at this
point I want to invite you to participate in the ICES Methods WG. Feel free to
forward the invitation to those you think might be interested. Registration is
simple, just send me an email!

All the best,

Arni
