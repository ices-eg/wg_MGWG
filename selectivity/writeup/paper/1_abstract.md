## Abstract

Fisheries stock assessment and management advice mainly focuses on the overall fishing pressure and annual catches in tonnes. Much less attention is paid to selectivity, whether it would be advisable to shift the fishery towards younger or older fish. In this study, we look at the main Atlantic cod stocks in European and North American waters (n = 15) and evaluate the likely effects of shifting the selectivity towards younger or older fish. The analytical approach incorporates the life history, stock size, and average catch composition from each fishery in recent years. The majority of cod fished in the North Sea and Celtic Seas tend to be at age 1 and 2, while ages 5 and 6 are most common in the catches of Northeast Arctic and Icelandic cod, with the other cod stocks somewhere in between. The stocks that are fished at the youngest ages are also the stocks with the fastest somatic growth rate. Essentially all the Atlantic cod fisheries would benefit from shifting the selectivity to older fish, with a predicted increase in both the annual yield and spawning biomass in the long term. A similar analytical approach could be used to evaluate the likely effects of shifting the selectivity of other fish species sharing habitat with the cod.
