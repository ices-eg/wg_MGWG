Stock status from the last full assessment (DFO 2019) indicated that SSB was 48%
of Blim and scientific advice stated that removals must be kept to the lowest
possible level until the stock has cleared the critical zone.

This report updates the estimated SSB 2021 / Blim = 52%.

A rebuilding plan for Northern cod was released in 2020 (DFO 2020), with a
Harvest Decision Rule (HDR) aimed at keeping fishing mortality low while the
stock is in the critical zone (specifically 25-75% of the LRP).

Stewardship inshore fisheries aim to monitor the stock. The stewardship TAC in
2020 was 12350 tonnes.

DFO announced in 2017 that Northern cod would be assessed annually for five
years starting in 2018.

Stomach contents indicate food limitation, as key forage species like capelin
and shrimp have declined. Estimated M in 2020 is 0.51, while the average M over
the last 10 years was 0.39.

SSBcurrent in 2021 is 411,000 tonnes.

Average SSB average from 1983-1989 is 790,000 tonnes: 411/790 = 52%.

F for ages 5+ in 2020 was 0.02, similar to the average of the last 10 years.

Average annual recruitment for the five most recent cohorts is 314 million,
around a quarter of the historical recruitment level from the 1980s.

Catches were 500 kt in 1960-1970 and then 200 kt in 1975-1990. Near zero catch
since 1992.
