Cod in Division 3M

Recommendation for 2024

Catches up to 3/4 Flim are projected to result in a very low probability (<10%)
of the stock going below Blim and of fishing mortality exceeding Flim in 2024.

All fishing scenarios with fishing mortality less than 2/3 Flim are projected to
promote growth in SSB.

SC therefore advices that exploitation should not exceed 2/3 Flim in 2024.

Stock status

SSB declined rapidly since 2017 but has remained stable during the last 3 years
and is estimated to be above Blim.

Since 2013, recruitment has varied at intermediate levels, much lower than those
observed in 2011-2012.

F has remained below Flim since the fishery reopened in 2010. F has decreased
since 2019 and in 2022 is below Flim with a high probability.

Figure 1

Catch was 30 kt in 1963-1995, zero catches in 1999-2008, then 10 kt 2010-2019,
and again very low in 2020-2022.

SSB/Blim has been > 1 since 2008. In recent years, SSB/Blim has declined from 5
to 2.

F/Flim has been < 1 since 2000.

Recruitment was nearly zero from 1993 to 2004 but has been better since then.
